Hello! And welcome to the React from zero to hero

This course is unique as compared to other React introductions because this course attempts to teach you not only React but the ecosystem around React. When I was learning React myself, I found myself frustrated that it seemed like every tutorial started on step 14 and left out the steps 1-13 of how to set up a React project. React is nearly never used by itself, so it's useful to know the tools you're using. I believe you, as a developer, should know how your tools work and what purpose they're serving. Many times have I taught courses similar to this one to hear people using tools and complaining about them because they don't actually know why they're using them, just that they're necessary. As such, in this course, we show you how to build projects without using any tools at all and introduce the various tools one at a time, so you understand the actual problem being solved by the tool. Hopefully, given the knowledge of the problem solved by the tool, you'll embrace the tools despite their complexities due to the ease and power they offer you.

## Who is this course for

You, hopefully. ðŸ˜„ This course is for anyone who wants to know React better. The course assumes only a basic knowledge of JavaScript ([start here if you need help with that][bootcamp]). This course will equally be useful for people learning React for the first time as it is for people who have written some React but want to understand the tools better. If you have taken previous versions of this course, this course will feature current versions (as of writing) of all the libraries and update on all the new features that have since come out.

## Set up

This course works and has been tested on both macOS and Windows 10. It also will work very well on Linux (just follow the macOS instructions). You shouldn't need a particularly powerful computer for any part of this course. 8GB of RAM would more than get you through it and you can likely get away with less.

- Install Node.js. Make sure your version of Node.js is at least 14, preferably the latest stable release. I prefer using nvm to install Node.js, [see setup instructions here][nvm]. I'll be using Node.js 18.
- While you do not have to use [Visual Studio Code][vsc], it is what I will be using and I'll be giving you fun tips for it along the way. I was on the VS Code team so I'm a bit biased!
- People often ask me what my coding set up is so let's go over that really quick!
  - Font: [Mono Lisa][mono]. Be sure to [enable ligatures][ligatures] in VS Code! If you want ligatures without Mono Lisa, check out Microsoft's [Cascadia Code][cascadia].
  - Theme: I actually just like Dark+, the default VS Code theme. Though I do love [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl][night-owl] too.
  - Terminal: I just switched back to using macOS's built in terminal. [iTerm2][iterm] is great too. On Windows I love [Windows Terminal][terminal].
  - VS Code Icons: the [vscode-icons][icons] extension.
